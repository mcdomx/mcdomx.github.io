summary: Final group project for Advanced Data Science class at Harvard.  Data available at the beginning of various large NYC capital projects is used to determine how likely the initial project budget and timeline will be after 3 years. This project compares various prediction methodologies as well as data engineering to find a latent reference class for the projects.
