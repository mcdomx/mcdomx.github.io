summary: Fashion-related items are segmented from images using Mask RCNN.  Segmented objects are identified based on a large dataset provided in a Kaggle competition. An existing implementation of the Mask RCNN model is modified to apply to this project.  This project was the result of a group effort for my course in Computer Vision.
