				<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large"> Introduction </p>
				<p>I am a recent Harvard extension graduate with a master's degree in Software Engineering.
					During my studies, I quickly recognized the transitional importance and enormous potential of
					deep learning and artificial intelligence which motivated me to simultaneously pursue a certificate in Data
					Science. </p>
				<p>Building on a successful corporate career focused on financial, process and IT management, I intend to
					combine my technical skills and business experience to find new ways of solving age-old business challenges.</p>
				<p> I have accumulated extensive experience in business operations and management with a unique set of skills
					that position me well to understand a broad scope of business functions and markets:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Controller of multi-location large engineered equipment manufacturer</li>
					<li>Led numerous US and international new acquisition integrations</li>
					<li>CIO of US Siemens Mobile Phone business</li>
					<li>Digital transformation project leadership</li>
					<li>Worked in Germany for 5 years (fluent in German) at Siemens Corporate headquarters</li>
